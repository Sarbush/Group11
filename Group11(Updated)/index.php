                <h2>Welcome to PHP Library Rental</h2>
                <p>Hello, welcome to our website! This is your one-stop shop for books,
                    CDs, audiobooks, and board games to entertain yourself during 
                    these unprecedented times. The site works much the same as a regular
                    library. Click on any items you want, add them to your cart, and weâ€™ll 
                    have you make an account with us to guarantee that your materials will
                    be shipped to your door within a week. At the end of the regular two-week
                    period, place your library items in your mailbox and we will take them back.</p>
