                <ul>
                    <li>Question: Am I allowed to check out more than one item at a time?</li>
                    <li>Answer: Absolutely! Just be respectful of other people who might be using
                        this site and recognize that while you can check out five board games, 
                        you will probably not use all of them at once.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question: How is the PHP Library Rental business keeping up to the government standards of social distancing and cleanliness?</li>
                    <li>Answer: Our business is concerned with the health of our customers. We have a free, no-contact delivery of any rented items to your mailbox and we wear gloves and mask when handling any products. We also wipe each item down with an alcohol-based cleanser upon their return to the library.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question: Can I extend any time on the items I have checked out?</li>
                    <li>Answer: No, due to the high demand we may have to alternate forms of entertainment at this time. The item is due two weeks after its rental date to give another customer a chance to use them. However, you may rent the same item again once it has securely been returned to our library.
